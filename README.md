- Role: Computer Science student, developer
- University: University of South Wales
- Interests: Computer science, software development, sports
- Primary languages: python, C++
- Current focus: Learning advanced C++ and returning to our python -based campus trading app
- Notable project (in progress): CampusSwap — a Java application to make it easier for students to trade or give away items on campus to reduce waste (work is temporarily paused while I upskill in C++)
  
Quick summary:
I enjoy practical projects that make a positive impact on my community. I contribute to backend logic and system design, and I like to pair that with hands-on learning—right now by diving deeper into C++.
