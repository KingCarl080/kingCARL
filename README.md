## Tse Carl (KingCarl080)
- Role: Computer Science student, developer
- University: University of South Wales
- Interests: Computer science, software development, sports
- Skills; Math and Physics, Microsoft softwares, Administrative roles, and communication skills, also very athletic.
- Primary languages: python, C++
- Current focus: Learning advanced C++ and returning to our python -based campus trading app
- Notable project (in progress): 'RONC-exchange' — a python based application which me and some colleagues started working on for our final assesment during foundation year meant to make it easier for students to trade or give away items on campus to reduce waste (work is temporarily paused while I upskill in C++)
  
Quick summary:
I enjoy practical projects that make a positive impact on my community. I contribute to backend logic and system design, and I like to pair that with hands-on learning—right now by diving deeper into C++.
